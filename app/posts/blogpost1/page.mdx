# Relative Motion Orthosis (RMO) Overview

## Background

A relative motion orthosis (RMO) is a splint/ orthosis that keeps one or more digits in either relative flexion or extension compared to the other digits of the affected hand. The orthosis is usually fabricated over 3-4 proximal phalanx changing the angle of the affected MCP joint. The orthosis can either be a relative motion flexion (RMF) orthosis or a relative motion extension (RME) orthosis. The naming convention is based on the angle of the affected MCP joint. An RMO keeping the middle finger MCP joint in relative extension would be called a RME orthosis. (include a picture of an RMO to better visualize this).

The relative motion was first used toThe relative motion was first used to to utilize the quadria effect (https://www.jhandtherapy.org/article/S0894-1130(23)00009-1/fulltext) to create laxity at the affected extensor tendon after an extensor tendon repair in zone IV - VI. The RME orthosis would keep the affected digits 25-30 degrees in extension with the addition of a volar wrist splint to protect the affected repair site and allow early active motion.

## Treatment/ Diagnosis

Currently there is evidence to support its use in:

- Extension tendon repairs (zones IV - VI)
  - as noted above it is used to protect the repair utilizing the quadria effect
- Boutonniere deformities (PIP flexion lag/ contracture due to other conditions such as dupytrens)

Research is currently being done on the following conditions:

- Flexor tendon repairs
- trigger finger

### Extensor tendon repairs and the ICAM protocol

### Boutonniere deformities

##### Below is an interactive component you can use to provide you with examples of how to fabricate an RMO. This does not provide an exhaustive list of examples. However, it does provide you with good use cases for 3 - 4 finger RME/ RMF orthosis that will work in most cases where there is one affected digit. Click the "RME/RMF" to change the orientation of the splint and then click the digit you would like to select as "affected". The component will then show you how to fabricate / position you orthosis and what digits to include.
