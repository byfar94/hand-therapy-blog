# Relative Motion Orthosis (RMO) Overview

## The RMO

A relative motion orthosis (RMO) is a splint/ orthosis that keeps one or more digits in either relative flexion or extension compared to the other digits of the affected hand. The orthosis is usually fabricated over 3-4 proximal phalanx changing the angle of the affected MCP joint. The orthosis can either be a relative motion flexion (RMF) orthosis or a relative motion extension (RME) orthosis. The naming convention is based on the angle of the affected MCP joint. An RMO keeping the middle finger MCP joint in relative extension would be called a RME orthosis. [(Hirth, M. J., Howell, J. W., & O'Brien, L., 2016)](#relative-motion-orthoses-in-the-management-of-various-hand-conditions-a-scoping-review)

## The relatie motion concept

The concept of relative motion is the idea that changing the position of an MCP (metacarpophalangeal) joint in relation to adjacent digits can alter the tension of that digit's tendon due to the common muscle belly shared by the tendons of those adjacent digits [(Merritt, W., Robinson, S., & Hardy, M., 2023)](#a-commentary-from-the-pioneers-on-the-innovation-of-the-relative-motion-concept:-history,-biologic-considerations,-and-anatomic-rationale). It's easier to grasp this concept by understanding that muscles such as the EDC (responsable for digital extension) and FDP (responsable for IP flexion) have a shared muscle belly with tendons that diverge into separate digits. The EDC for example is one muscle but as it's tendon desends down the forearm branches off into 4 separate tendons that travel to the index, middle, ring, and small finger. If you for instance place the middle finger MCP joint in extension, relative the index and ring finger, you will create laxity (decrease tension) on the EDC tendon to the middle finger.

The relative motion orthosis was first developed to utilize the relative motion concept by creating laxity at the affected extensor tendon after an extensor tendon repair [(Howell, J. W., Merritt, W. H., & Robinson, S. J., 2005)](#Immediate-controlled-active-motion-following-zone-4-7-extensor-tendon-repair). The RME orthosis would keep the affected digits relative extension with the addition of a volar wrist splint to protect the affected repair site and allow early active motion.

##### Below is an interactive component you can use to provide you with examples of how to fabricate an RMO. This does not provide an exhaustive list of examples. However, it does provide you with good use cases for 3 - 4 finger RME/ RMForthosis that will work in most cases where there is one affected digit. Clickthe "RME/RMF" to change the orientation of the splint and then click the digityou would like to select as "affected". The component will then show you how to fabricate / position you orthosis and what digits to include.

## Treatment/ Diagnosis

Altough the RMO was first introduced to protect extensor tendon repairs at extensor zone 5 it has expanded to be used in a variety of cases since its inception.

Currently there is evidence to support its use in:

- Extension tendon repairs (zones IV - VII)
- Saggital band injury/ EDC dislocation
- Boutonniere deformities (PIP flexion lag/ contracture due to other conditions such as dupytrens)
  <br />
  <br />
- Research is currently being done on the following conditions:
  - Trigger finger
  - Flexor tendon repairs

### Extensor tendon repairs and the ICAM protocol

As mentione above the RMO orthosis was first designed to protect extensor tendon repairs while simultaneously encouraging early active motion to reduce the negative outcomes of more restrictive and immobilzing protocols.

The ICAM protocol stands for Immediate controlled active motion protocol. This involves the use of a relative motions orthosis and wrist orthosis to position the affected digit in relative extension and well as the wrist in extension. It was originally more restrictive in degrees of extension and used to include a gutter spint to prevent IP flexion of the affected digit.

The idea was first tested on cadavers in the late 70s where keeping the affected digit in relative extension (25 -30 degrees) prevented a weak repair at extensor zone 6 from rupturing when pulling on the EDC tendon (full extension of the digit) and pulling on the FDP (full flexion of the digit) [(Merritt, W., Robinson, S., & Hardy, M., 2023)](#a-commentary-from-the-pioneers-on-the-innovation-of-the-relative-motion-concept:-history,-biologic-considerations,-and-anatomic-rationale).

The first patient treated with the ICAM for an extensor tendon repair had a middle finger zone 5 repair. Out of caution the wrist was splinted in 40 degrees of extenson, the middle finger had an RME orthosis with the affected MCP joint in 25-30 degrees of extension, and a volar gutter splint was attached to keep the IP joints in extension. The RMO was also attached to the volar wrist splint. Keeping the wirst the degrees of extension and not allowing the IP joints to go into flexion was also to reduce the tension on the affected repair. The affected MCP joint was allowed ~40 degrees of flexion. This was a conservative version of the ICAM and has since become less restrictive. It is now more common to splint the wrist in 20-25 degrees of extension and use a RME orthosis with 15-20 degrees of relative extension. The RMO and wrist splint are no longer generally attached and the gutter splint has been removed completely [(Howell, J. W., Merritt, W. H., & Robinson, S. J., 2005)](#Immediate-controlled-active-motion-following-zone-4-7-extensor-tendon-repair). The ICAM protocol has also expanded from extensor repair zones V-VI to include IV and VII.
